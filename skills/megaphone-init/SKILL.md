name: megaphone-init
description: Initialize the Megaphone distribution toolkit for a repo. Use this skill whenever the user wants to set up megaphone, start using megaphone, init megaphone for this project, get help marketing or distributing their repo for the first time, or says things like "I just built a thing, help me ship it" or "I want to launch this but I don't know where to start." Trigger especially when the user is a non-technical or vibe-coder type who has a working project but no marketing materials, no social presence, and doesn't know where to share. Even if they don't say "megaphone" explicitly, trigger when their request is clearly about starting a distribution effort from scratch on a repo and there is no `.megaphone/profile.json` yet.

# megaphone-init

The user has a project but doesn't know how to distribute it. This skill produces the artifact every other megaphone skill depends on: a project profile that captures what the project is, who it's for, and how the user wants to sound — saved to `.megaphone/profile.json` so it persists across sessions.

The profile is small but high-leverage. Every later skill (`megaphone-assets`, `megaphone-outreach`, `megaphone-post`, `megaphone-publish`, `megaphone-schedule`, `megaphone-audit`, `megaphone-demo`, `megaphone-digest`) reads from it. A bad profile produces generic, AI-sounding output. A good one — especially the voice samples — produces drafts the user actually wants to ship.

## Workflow

### 0. Resolve the target project directory

Megaphone always operates on a single project root. Claude Code sessions almost always start in `$HOME`, so do **not** assume cwd is the project. Resolve the target before doing anything else, and do it without producing visible shell errors.

#### 0a. Probe cwd silently

Run **one** Bash call that is guaranteed to exit 0 — never chain with `&&`, never let `ls` fail on a missing glob. Use a wrapped form like this:

```bash
sh -c '
  cd "$PWD"
  echo "CWD=$PWD"
  echo "BASENAME=$(basename "$PWD")"
  for f in .git package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod README.md .megaphone; do
    [ -e "$f" ] && echo "HAS=$f"
  done
  exit 0
'
```

A directory counts as a "plausible project root" if it has any of: `.git/`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `README.md`, or an existing `.megaphone/`.

#### 0b. Branch on what you found

**Case A — cwd IS a plausible project root** (we're already inside a project):

Ask the user a single confirmation:

> "Initialize Megaphone for **`<basename>`** at `<cwd>`? (Y/n)"

- Y or no answer → use cwd, continue to step 1.
- N → fall through to Case B.

**Case B — cwd is NOT a project root** (e.g. `$HOME`, `/tmp`, empty dir):

Don't print a shell-style error. Just tell the user plainly that we need to pick a project, then **try memory candidates first** if any exist — that's the priority path. If no memory exists, skip straight to "paste an absolute path."

1. **Look for the user's memory index.** Try the glob `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` and pick the first match. Use a silent probe like:

   ```bash
   sh -c 'for f in ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md; do [ -e "$f" ] && echo "FOUND=$f" && break; done; exit 0'
   ```

   If nothing matches, jump to step 3 (path-paste fallback).

2. **If a memory index exists, parse it for `project`-type entries** (typically files named `project_*.md` or `*_startup.md` referenced from `MEMORY.md`). Each project memory usually contains a path or repo location — pull the project name and any directory hint. Present them as a numbered list:

   > Megaphone needs a project. Here are projects I found in your memory:
   >
   > 1. **\<name\>** — `<path-if-known>` *(or `path unknown` if not)*
   > 2. ...
   >
   > Reply with a number, or paste an absolute path if your project isn't listed.

3. **No memory found, or user pastes a path:** ask plainly:

   > Megaphone needs a project. Paste the absolute path of the project you want to distribute (e.g. `/Users/you/Developer/my-app`).

4. **If the user picks a number but the path is unknown**, ask once: "What's the absolute path for `<name>`?" Optionally offer to search common dev folders: `find ~/Developer ~/code ~/src ~/projects ~/work -maxdepth 3 -type d -iname "<name>" 2>/dev/null`.
5. **If the user pastes a path**, verify it exists with a silent probe (`[ -d "<path>" ] && echo OK || echo MISSING`). If missing, say so and re-ask.

#### 0c. Lock in absolute paths

Once a target path is resolved:

- Use **absolute paths for every Read/Write** for the rest of this skill. Don't rely on cwd.
- For Bash calls, prefix with `cd "<absolute-path>" && ...` so each call is self-contained.
- Never write `.megaphone/` outside the resolved target.

#### 0d. Bash hygiene for later steps

When probing for files that may or may not exist, always:

- Use `[ -e "<path>" ]` guards instead of bare `ls`.
- Wrap multi-step probes in `sh -c '...; exit 0'` so the call always exits 0.
- Never chain unknowns with `&&`.

This is the rule that prevents the "red error block on init" the user has explicitly objected to.

### 1. Detect whether megaphone is already initialized

Check for `.megaphone/profile.json` at the resolved project root.

- If it exists, read it and ask the user which path they want:
  - **refresh the profile** — re-run steps 2–4 to update tagline, audience, voice samples
  - **manage connections** — jump to step 6 (status table + connect/reconnect for distribution channels)
  - **jump to another skill** — `/megaphone-assets`, `/megaphone-post`, `/megaphone-outreach`, `/megaphone-publish`, `/megaphone-schedule`, `/megaphone-audit`, `/megaphone-demo`, `/megaphone-digest`
- If it doesn't, proceed.

### 2. Scan the repo silently

Before asking the user anything, gather what's already obvious. This dramatically reduces how much you need to interview them.

Read in this order, only what exists:
- `README.md` (or README at any case) — pull the title, first paragraph, and any "what is this" / "features" sections
- `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod` — name, description, keywords, license, homepage URL
- Top-level directory layout — `src/`, `app/`, `pages/`, etc. tells you the framework
- `.git/config` or `git remote -v` (run via Bash) — the GitHub URL and default branch
- `git log -50 --oneline` (via Bash) — recent activity, freshness, themes
- `package.json` "homepage" or any obvious "Live demo:" / "Try it:" link in README — the deployed URL
- Any images in `/docs`, `/.github`, `/screenshots` — record their paths

If you can't run Bash (rare in Claude Code, but possible), do as much as you can with file reads alone. Don't get stuck.

### 3. Ask only what you couldn't infer

Use AskUserQuestion sparingly. Aim for **three questions max**, only the ones the repo scan didn't answer. Common gaps:

- **Audience** — "Who is this for? Other developers, end users, a niche community, all of the above?" — only ask if the README doesn't make this obvious.
- **Goals** — "What's the win? GitHub stars, paying customers, a job, just feedback?" — this changes which channels to target later.
- **Voice samples** — "Paste 1–3 things you've written that sound like you (a tweet, a slack message, an old blog post). I'll match that voice when drafting posts. If you don't have any, just say 'no samples' and I'll default to a clean, friendly indie-maker tone."

If the user explicitly skips voice samples, default to: "warm, plainspoken, slightly understated, no marketing speak, no exclamation points unless something genuinely shipped, no em-dashes used as hype punctuation."

### 4. Write `.megaphone/profile.json`

Create the directory if it doesn't exist. Schema:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
  "project": {
    "name": "string",
    "tagline": "one line, ≤80 chars",
    "what_it_does": "1–2 sentence description",
    "stack": ["tech", "stack", "items"],
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/...",
    "deployed_url": "https://... or null",
    "license": "MIT/etc."
  },
  "audience": {
    "primary": "developers | indie-dev | vibe-coder | end-users | designers | founders | other (specify)",
    "niches": ["specific communities"]
  },
  "goals": {
    "primary": "stars | users | revenue | feedback | job | other",
    "target_launch_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null"
  },
  "voice": {
    "samples": ["paste 1", "paste 2"],
    "guidance": "the inferred or default voice rules"
  },
  "platforms": {
    "connected": []
  },
  "screenshots": ["path/to/image.png"],
  "notes": "anything else captured during init"
}
```

`platforms.connected[]` is a list of canonical platform IDs (see `skills/megaphone-publish/references/platform-ids.md`) the user has authenticated. It is appended to during step 6 (Connect distribution channels) and read by `megaphone-post`, `megaphone-publish`, and `megaphone-schedule` so they default to platforms the user actually has set up.

`audience.primary` accepts the values above; `indie-dev` and `vibe-coder` are the most common for megaphone users and influence per-platform best-time defaults in `megaphone-schedule`.

Also create the empty subdirectories the other skills consume so no downstream skill has to guard a missing path:

- `.megaphone/assets/` — `megaphone-assets`, `megaphone-demo` outputs
- `.megaphone/posts/` and `.megaphone/posts/evergreen/` — `megaphone-post` dated drafts and `megaphone-schedule` cadence pool
- `.megaphone/metrics/` — `megaphone-digest` weekly reports
- `.megaphone/published/` — `megaphone-publish` JSONL receipts
- `.megaphone/schedule/` — `megaphone-schedule` queue and cadences
- `.megaphone/outreach/` — `megaphone-outreach` Phase 1–3 raw output
- `.megaphone/audits/` — `megaphone-audit` landing/journey reports
- `.megaphone/launch/` — `megaphone-outreach` Phase 4 launch artifacts (`launch-plan.md`, `sequence.json`, per-channel `<platform>.md`)

Add `.megaphone/` to `.gitignore` if a `.gitignore` exists — the whole directory is local runtime state, not source.

### 5. Suggest the next step, briefly

Don't dump the full menu of skills on the user. Pick the single highest-value next move based on what they said:

- If they want to ship soon → "Want me to draft launch assets next? (`/megaphone-assets`)"
- If they want stars → "Want me to find awesome-lists where this belongs? (`/megaphone-outreach`)"
- If they're early and unsure → "Want a quick set of marketing assets so the README and socials don't look empty? (`/megaphone-assets`)"

Keep the suggestion to one line. **Before ending the turn, also walk the user through §6 below** if `platforms.connected[]` is empty — having at least one channel connected makes every later skill (post, publish, schedule) more useful.

### 6. Connect distribution channels (optional, recommended)

Megaphone publishes locally — no SaaS in the middle, credentials live in `~/.megaphone/credentials/<id>.json` (chmod 0600), shared across every project on this machine. Connect once, use everywhere.

#### 6a. Show the current status

Run the auth helper and parse its JSON output:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megaphone-publish/scripts/auth.py status
```

The output is a single JSON line: `{"platforms": [{"platform": "<id>", "connected": <bool>, "since": "<ISO8601 or null>", "expired": <bool>}, ...]}`. Render it as a markdown table:

```
Platform    Status                              Action
Bluesky     ✓ connected (since 2026-04-15)      reconnect
X           ⚠ token expired                     reconnect
LinkedIn    – not connected                     connect
dev.to      – not connected                     connect
Reddit      – not connected                     connect
Mastodon    – not connected                     connect
Hashnode    – not connected                     connect
```

Icons: `✓` connected, `⚠` expired (re-auth needed), `–` not connected.

#### 6b. Ask which platforms to connect

Single multi-select question:

> Want to connect any platforms now? Reply with platform IDs (e.g. `bluesky linkedin`), `all` to walk every disconnected one, or `skip` to do this later.

Use the canonical IDs from `skills/megaphone-publish/references/platform-ids.md`. Aliases like `twitter` or `bsky` should be normalized before invoking the connector.

#### 6c. Run each connect

For each chosen platform:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megaphone-publish/scripts/auth.py connect <id>
```

Stream stdout and stderr to the user — the connector prints platform-specific instructions, opens the browser for OAuth where applicable, or prompts for a token paste. Wait for it to finish before moving to the next platform.

After each successful connect:

1. Read `.megaphone/profile.json`.
2. Append the platform `<id>` to `platforms.connected[]` (de-dup if already present).
3. Write the file back.

If a connect fails, surface the error verbatim and offer to retry that platform or skip it. Do NOT mutate `platforms.connected[]` for failed connects.

#### 6d. Print the final status

Re-run the status command and render the updated table. End with a one-line confirmation: e.g. "Connected 2 platforms. Two more available — run `/megaphone-init` and pick `manage connections` whenever you're ready."

### 6.1. Manage connections later

These three actions cover every post-init scenario:

- **Check status:** re-invoke `/megaphone-init` and pick `manage connections` from §1's existing-profile menu, or run `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megaphone-publish/scripts/auth.py status` from anywhere.
- **Reconnect a failed or expired platform:** `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megaphone-publish/scripts/auth.py connect <id>` — overwrites the existing credentials. Or invoke `/megaphone-publish` and ask to reconnect; it offers the same flow as a fallback.
- **Remove a connection:** `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/megaphone-publish/scripts/auth.py disconnect <id>` — deletes the credential file. Also remove the `<id>` from `platforms.connected[]` in the project's `.megaphone/profile.json`.

Two important truths to surface to the user during init:

1. **Credentials are user-global, not per-project.** They live at `~/.megaphone/credentials/<id>.json` (chmod 0600) and are shared across every project on this machine. They are never stored inside the repo.
2. **Per-project preferences and overrides** (visibility, hashtag policy, draft directories) live inside each project's `.megaphone/` and are repo-local.

If a publish or schedule call later reports `auth_error` or `token expired`, the user can always come back to §6c and reconnect — that path is the canonical recovery.

## Edge cases

- **Empty repo / no README** — Tell the user honestly: "There's not much in the repo yet for me to work with. Want to give me a 2-sentence pitch and I'll generate a starter README to anchor the profile?" Then proceed with their pitch as the source of truth.
- **Monorepo / multiple projects** — Ask which package the profile is for. Megaphone v1 is single-project per profile.
- **Private repo, no remote** — Profile still works; just leave `repo_url` empty and note it for later.
- **User refuses to answer** — Fall back to defaults from the repo scan and proceed. A profile that's 70% correct is better than a stuck conversation.

## Why these choices matter

- **Voice samples are the single biggest quality lever.** Three pasted messages turn generic LLM-speak into "this sounds like me." Treat them as gold.
- **Persisting to `.megaphone/profile.json`** means later skills don't reinterview the user every time. They're not building distribution from scratch each session.
- **Three questions, max** respects the user's attention. Onboarding fatigue is the most common reason people abandon tools like this.
